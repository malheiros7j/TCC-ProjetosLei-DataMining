=head1 NAME

IO::Dirent - Access to dirent structs returned by readdir

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use IO::Dirent;

  opendir DIR, "/usr/local/foo";
  my @entries = readdirent(DIR);
  closedir DIR;

  print $entries[0]->{name}, "\n";
  print $entries[0]->{type}, "\n";
  print $entries[0]->{inode}, "\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Returns a list of hashrefs. Each hashref contains the name of the
directory entry, its inode for the filesystem it resides on and its
type (if available). If the file type or inode are not available, it
won't be there!

B<IO::Dirent> exports the following symbols by default:

    readdirent

The following tags may be exported to your namespace:

    ALL

which includes B<readdirent> and the following symbols:

    DT_UNKNOWN
    DT_FIFO
    DT_CHR
    DT_DIR
    DT_BLK
    DT_REG
    DT_LNK
    DT_SOCK
    DT_WHT

These symbols can be used to test the file type returned by
B<readdirent> in the following manner:

    for my $entry ( readdirent(DIR) ) {
        next unless $entry->{'type'} == DT_LNK;

        print $entry->{'name'} . " is a symbolic link.\n";
    }

For platforms that do not implement file type in its dirent struct,
B<readdirent> will return a hashref with a single key/value of 'name'
and the filename (effectively the same as readdir). This is subject
to change, if I can implement some of the to do items below.

=head1 CAVEATS

This was written on FreeBSD which implements a robust (but somewhat
non-standard) dirent struct and which includes a file type entry. I
have plans to make this module more portable and useful by doing a
stat on each directory entry to find the file type and inode number
when the dirent.h does not implement it otherwise.

Improvements and additional ports are welcome.

=head1 TO DO

=over 4

=item *

For platforms that do not implement a dirent struct with file type,
do a stat on the entry and populate the structure anyway.

=item *

Consider making B<readdirent> return a list of objects instead of a
list of hashrefs. Nah...

=item *

Do some memory profiling (I'm not sure if I have any leaks or not).
